# React Starter Template

I've tried to make this starter kit as lightweight as possible while still providing all of the tools you'll need to build a production ready app. If you're new to React this may seem overwhelming. Don't worry, that is a natural reaction to the fire hose spray of information that will hit you when you poke around the repo. I'm planning to do a video on how it all works in order to make onboarding less cumbersome. 

## Features

This template comes with a number of features. 

  * React
  * React DOM
  * React Router
  * Webpack 
  * Webpack Hot Reloading
  * Redux
  * Redux React
  * Redux Simple Router
  * Redux Thunk
  * Redux DevTools
  * CSS Modules
  * Post CSS
  * CSS Next
  * Acceptance Tests with Chimp.js
  * Unit Tests with Karma/Mocha
  * Production Ready

## Usage

This repo comes with a couple of useful commands. 

### NPM Start

While in the root directory of the project run the following command to start the webpack dev server:

```
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see your new app

### NPM Deploy

While in the root directory of the project run the following command to build your React app into a production ready bundle:

```
npm run deploy
```

You will now have a __build__ directory in your project root that contains a number of files. If you open the index.html file in your browser you'll see your React app.
